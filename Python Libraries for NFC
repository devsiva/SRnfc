For windows we need WinUSB and libUSB. 
    To install libUSB(windows)
we need to install manually both WinUSB and libUSB. Microsoft provides the guidelines for the installation for WinUSB. 

Then we need to install libusb 
  • Download libusb (Downloads -> Latest Windows Binaries). 
. • For 32-bit Windows: – Copy MS32\dll\libusb-1.0.dll to C:\Windows\System32.
After installing the WinUSB an libUSB we need to install latest version of python.

Python 2.7 is used in my poject,because NFC is not supported by python 3. Once python is installed use pip method to install latest version of NFCpy.
$ Pip install -U nfcpy
Then we need to configure the path, otherwise we cannot access the pip in command line.     
For example, C:/python2.7/scripts/pip.exe
